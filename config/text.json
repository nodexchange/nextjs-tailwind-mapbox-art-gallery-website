    "first": "Martin and Alyssa are trained professional latin dancers with years of experience. Alyssa has been dancing for more than 15 years, while Martin has been dancing for roughly 9 years. Salsa, Bachata, Cha Cha Cha, Merengue, and Cumbia are their specialties.",
    "second": "Martin's latin dance journey began in London, United Kingdom. He discovered his love for dancing as a modest student with no prior dance experience. What began as a weekly one-hour hobby had grown into a six-nights-a-week addiction. He then found bachata and became a member of London's first Island Touch team. He frequently attends international congresses to learn from the finest in order to advance his newly discovered interest. He had the opportunity of performing with Ataca and Alemana, taking many sensual bachata workshops with Korke and Judith (the creators of Sensual Bachata), and learning alongside Alyssa at international congresses.",
    "third": "Alyssa began dancing Salsa and Bachata with her mother as a hobby, but she quickly realised she had fallen in love with Latin dance. She was invited to join the 'Prodigy Salsa Company' in California during her first year, and she stayed with them for a few years, dancing and performing all around the West Coast of the United States. When she moved to the UK, she continued her passion by joining the 'Diablo Dance Company' and teaching salsa and bachata in a variety of London locations, assisting individuals in reaching their full potential in a pleasant and comfortable environment. She has since performed at a variety of venues and congresses in the United Kingdom and Europe. She is passionate about assisting others in learning, and she teaches at a pace that is 'just right' for each student so that they may master and enjoy the thrill of dance."

  "about": {
    "main:": "What is Bachata Sensual Dance?",
    "first": "Bachata is a beautiful and sensual dance, that originated in the Dominican Republic in the 1960s as a fusion of Merengue, Bolero, and Son Cubano. Following Salsa, Bachata is the second most prominent Latin American music and dance genre in the world, and it has grown extremely popular in the United Kingdom. At Latin Shine Dance Company, we offer our students fundamentals of traditional Bachata dancing with the focus on Sensual variant.",
    "second": "Sensual Bachata was created by Korke Escalona, that introduced to the dance a more complex follower and leader patterns, body isolations, and a stronger representation of individual musicality through body movement and partner connection. In his words, Korke interpreted the instruments with longer movements and isolations, in other words, a higher corporal expression. Without dismissing the origins and keeping the essence of the traditional bachata.",
